      <p>
        Welcome to my digital journal where I will be documenting my thoughts and challenges throughout my software development bootcamp journey, my hope is that when you are reading through my journal throughout the weeks you will be able to see what I‚Äôve learnt how I have overcome any challenges that I have faced during the weeks of the course.
        </p>
        <p>The reason why I chose to enrol and start the course is because I have always been interested in coding and separately how things are made from the inside out my main goal is to be able to design make a functioning website for my mums healthcare training website. I have a passion for DIY, I enjoy traveling, going to the gym & eating. with coding I feel it also teaches you how to be more patience in what ever task you are doing.</p>
    <p>If you notice any spelling mistakes, I apologize in advance it is not my greatest strength, I do hope you enjoy reading about my journey. </p>
   <p>Thanks Management üòä</p>
