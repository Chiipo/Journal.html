<p> Monday:  
    Introduction to REACT APP, we created the REACT app using npx create-react-app this started  the installation process for the app. To show the app within a browser you would need to npm start within the terminal and this will initialise the process to view, you would have something like this:
    You can now view my ”app name” in the browser.   
     Local: http://localhost:3000    	
     On Your Network: http://192.168.0.6:3000  	
     Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use npm run build.
    webpack compiled successfully  </p>
